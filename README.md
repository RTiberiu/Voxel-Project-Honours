<h1 id="design-and-methodology">Design and Methodology</h1>
<p>Since the project doesn’t follow a clear existing design, the
implementation steps and required technologies had to be initially
explored. An agile methodology was employed, breaking down the project
into three main tasks: technology stack, terrain generation, and NPC
ecosystem, which were then further subdivided into more digestible
subtasks.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-and-constraints">Requirements and Constraints</h2>
<p>To achieve the performance and optimisations needed for the project,
with a smooth minimum 60 frames per second (FPS), C++ is the programming
language selected, as it provides low‑level control over memory
allocation and footprint that other languages typically abstract
away.</p>
<p>As for the rendering side, although the Vulkan graphics API was
initially considered for its performance and granular control of
resources, it was ultimately passed over due to its steep learning curve
and the project’s tight schedule. Instead, Unreal Engine 5 was selected,
as it supports C++ and reduces the overhead of handling the GPU pipeline
and shader management, among other things.</p>
<p>Thus, the requirements for the project are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement the project entirely in C++, instead of Unreal’s
Blueprint system, to reduce any unnecessary overhead.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a chunk system that divides a large object into
multiple blocks, computing each chunk’s mesh on demand instead of
generating one massive mesh for the entire object.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement an optimised mesh generation algorithm that can be used
for the landscape and foliage.</p></li>
<li><p>Use multi-threading to handle the terrain mesh generation and
other location calculations for spawning and despawning
objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Use mesh instancing for foliage objects that share the same mesh
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement an LOD system for collision and different draw
distances for terrain, types of foliage, and NPCs.</p></li>
<li><p>Spawn large numbers of various types of NPCs in the world and
visually display their most important attributes.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a custom pathfinding system for NPCs using A* and a
single multi-threaded Pathfinding Manager to handle requests.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a custom collision check for all NPCs and animate their
position to any location.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a single Decision System that all NPCs can use,
determining their actions based on their different base
parameters.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tools-technologies-and-hardware">Tools, Technologies, and
Hardware</h2>
<p>As mentioned, the main technology stack consists of C++ for the
project's logic, with Unreal Engine 5.4 primarily used just for
rendering. Visual Studio was used to integrate Unreal Engine with the
C++ implementation. There are also two libraries used for this project,
one is an A* implementation written by (Hui, 2023) in Java and
translated into C++ by the author of this project. The heuristic
function, however, is not present in the original library and was
implemented separately. The other library is FastNoiseLite by (Peck,
2021), which provides a highly optimised C++ implementation of various
noise types.</p>
<p>The NPC models and their animations used in this project were
purchased from (Omabuarts Studio, 2023) and are used with appropriate
licensing.</p>
<p>The hardware used for the implementation and, more importantly, the
evaluation tests for this project consists of an NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU (12
GB VRAM) and an Intel i9-12900K CPU (24 cores).</p>
<h2 id="algorithms-and-techniques">Algorithms and Techniques</h2>
<p>This project implements various algorithms and techniques aimed at
reducing computations, memory usage, and render times, ensuring the
real‐time feasibility of runtime mesh generation for terrain and
foliage, even with a large and actively simulated NPC ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="chunking-system">Chunking System</h3>
<p>The chunking system helps break down a larger object into smaller
blocks, creating meshes and rendering them on demand, rather than
generating and rendering one large one. This can be seen in Figure 1,
where the landscape is subdivided into smaller chunks that can be added
as needed, instead of rendering a single mesh for the entire landscape
in one draw call.</p>

<h3 id="binary-greedy-meshing">Binary Greedy Meshing</h3>
<p>The Greedy Meshing algorithm reduces the geometry and voxel data by
combining faces that are coplanar and adjacent into larger rectangular
polygons. As seen in Figure 2, each voxel has its own quad that is
formed of two triangles, and through Greedy Meshing, the quads are
combined and the vertex count and storage requirements are significantly
reduced.</p>

<p>Commonly, this technique is implemented by looping and checking the
bounds into which a quad can expand into. This can become
computationally expensive, considering that the algorithm is applied on
all six sides of a chunk, going up and down on each axis to cover all
the possible faces.</p>
<p>An improved version of this algorithm is implemented for this
project, as inspired by (Tantan, 2024), using bitwise operations
instead. 2D slices of the 3D chunk are built, as exemplified in Figure 3
and Figure 4.</p>

<p>Each column in the Figure 4 example would be a 64-bit integer, where
each 1 represents a solid voxel, and 0 represents empty air. As a
simplified example, to combine the quads starting from the integer at
position x10, we use C++’s method <code>std::countr_one()</code> to get the number of
1s, meaning the height of the quad, then a mask is created, containing
the same number of 1s as our height. Using the mask, we can try to
expand into the next integer, x9, by using the bitwise operation AND
(&amp;). While this is true, we can expand up until x4, create the quad,
and discard all the 1s used and continue the process until all the quads
in the 2D slice are combined. For this algorithm to work,
<code>std::countr_zero()</code> is also used to jump any empty gaps in the terrain
slice. The final result will be similar to the one seen in Figure 2.</p>

<h3 id="binary-face-culling">Binary Face Culling</h3>
<p>The face culling algorithm reduces the geometry even further, by only
computing and drawing the meshes that are visible to the player. As seen
in Figure 5, a side view slice of some terrain, only the outer faces are
displayed, with any covered voxel face being discarded and its mesh
never computed in the first place.</p>
<p>Similar to Greedy Meshing, this algorithm is commonly implemented by
looping and checking each voxel’s neighbour voxels to determine if each
of its faces are surrounded by air or solid blocks. This results in
keeping only the outer layer of an object, drawing only the necessary
faces and discarding any that’s being hidden.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>For this reason, a more optimised solution was implemented, as
inspired by (Tantan, 2024), using a Binary Face Culling algorithm where
bitwise operations replace most of the computationally heavy loops.</p>
<p>The same 2D slices of a 3D chunk used for the Binary Greedy Meshing
algorithm, as described in Figure 3, will be used to face cull the voxel
faces on all 3 axes, ascending and descending. This results in 6 sets of
planes, each set with 64 planes when a 64-bit integer is used. As the
outer edge of a plane is used for padding, to ensure faces are not drawn
in between chunks, this results in a 62x62 chunk.</p>
<p>The algorithm will calculate the left and right faces of each column.
In this case, each column is represented by a single 64-bit integer
within each of the 2D planes. The faces of each 64 voxel column will
then be computed in just a few bitwise operations.</p>
<p>In Figure 6 and 7, there is a breakdown of the 3 operations needed to
compute the left or right faces of a single column in a plane. The only
difference between the right or left faces computation is how we
bitshift in the first step.</p>

</div>

<p>For these examples, a 4x4 chunk is used, with a 1x1 outer padding.
Meaning that any faces outside of the red square will be discarded, as
they’re part of a different chunk. This ensures that any outer faces of
our current chunk that will be hidden by an adjacent chunk will not be
drawn.</p>
<p>The y2 column is used as an example, where the bits are shifted right
by 1, negated, and compared to the original y2 bits in an AND operation.
These final bits, when overlaid over the terrain, show that each
positive bit is a left face. Finally, in this example, the left-most
face is discarded, as it is part of the padding area, and only the
middle face is kept.</p>

<p>The Figure 7 example is similar to the Figure 6 explanation, but the
first step is to shift the original bits of the y2 column to the left
instead of right, thus getting in the end the right faces for the 64-bit
occupancy column.</p>
<h3 id="lod-system">LOD System</h3>
<p>The LOD system can be applied to various aspects of the game, such as
terrain and foliage draw distance, foliage density, and NPC spawn
distance. The idea is to reduce the strain on the GPU and CPU by
reducing computations or draw calls for objects that are too far from
the player and wouldn’t normally be visible. These objects would only be
loaded into the scene as the player moves in the world.</p>

</tbody>

</div>

<p>As seen in the simplified diagram of Figure 8, there can be multiple
LOD systems implemented at the same time, each handling the various
aspects mentioned. It is advantageous to employ multiple draw distances,
because larger objects visible to the player should extend further than
other smaller objects. This is to maintain the immersion and reduce the
visibility of bigger objects popping in when the player gets close.</p>
<h3 id="a-pathfinding-algorithm">A* Pathfinding Algorithm</h3>
<p>A* is a pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between
two points using a cost function:</p>
<p>f(n) = g(n) + h(n)</p>
<p>where g(n) is the actual cost from the start to node n, and h(n) is a
heuristic estimate from n to the goal.</p>
<p>It is efficient because it combines the accuracy of Dijkstra's
algorithm, meaning it always finds the best path, with the speed of
greedy best-first search, guiding the search toward the goal. In Figure
9, the nodes explored by the algorithm can be visualised, along with the
final shortest path to the target, while avoiding any collisions, as
guided by the cost function and the <code>successor()</code> function.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<p>The project implementation will, as before, be broken down into the
two main parts of the project: one focusing on terrain generation, and
the other on the NPC ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="terrain-generation-optimisations">Terrain Generation
Optimisations</h2>
<h3 id="binary-face-culling-1">Binary Face Culling</h3>
<p>For simplicity, building the binary columns for the orientation of
each axis based on the noise function is abstracted away from the full
terrain algorithm explanation. Its full implementation can be found in
the <code>CreateBinarySolidColumnsYXZ()</code> function instead. The important part
is that the <code>FaceCullingBinaryColumnsYXZ()</code> function works on these
created binary columns to create the culled face masks.</p>
<p>As discussed in Section 1.3.3., the algorithm has to run the face
culling algorithm on each column or 64-bit integer of the 3D chunk. In
Figure 10, there are 6 vectors that will store all the faces’ data of a
3D chunk as 64-bit integer columns, each traversing a different axis in
ascending or descending manner, as also shown in the Figure 3 diagram.
Furthermore, to prevent resizing with each insertion, the memory of each
vector is pre-allocated, since the dimensions of each chunk are known
beforehand. Lastly, to increase data retrieval performance, the usual 3D
array used to store the chunk data is flattened into a 1D array
instead.</p>

<p>As discussed in Section 1.3.2., the algorithm has to combine all
possible quads that are on the same elevation and are facing the same
way. This means that from the columnFaceMasks created in the previous
part, Section 2.1.1., 2D planes have to be created, as shown in Figure
3. columnFaceMasks is used as a base for the 2D planes because it
ensures only the visible quads will be combined.</p>

<p>In the code snippet of Figure 13, each axis’ planes are stored as

quads merged inside of <code>GreedyMeshingBinaryPlane()</code>.</p>
<p>The explanation of getting the height of a quad from Section 1.3.2.
can be seen in the code implementation in Figure 14, where
<code>std::countr_zero()</code> gets the starting point of a quad, and
<code>std::countr_one()</code> will get the height. A bit height mask is created and
this will then be further compared to adjacent rows in the plane,
expanding the width of the quad with each true operation.</p>

<h3 id="lod-system-collision">LOD System – Collision</h3>
<p>Similar to the diagram shown in Figure 8, where depending on distance
various attributes can be changed, the result can be seen in the in-game
implementation in Figure 16, where collision is updated only around the
player. The collision will continuously update as the player moves in
the world, making no difference from their perspective that further
terrain chunks or trees don’t have collision.</p>
<p>This technique was implemented because collision can be expensive to
compute, even with Unreal’s optimisations such as spatial partitioning,
where objects are grouped and far objects are discarded for certain
collision checks. It is still more efficient for objects to not have the
collision in the first place, if one is not needed.</p>

<p>In the code implementation in Figure 17, multiple function calls are
made to update various lists of objects that will eventually be updated
over many frames, as also seen in Figure 18. This functionality of
updating lists is made on a separate thread instead of the main game
thread, to ensure that all the distance calculations and list updates
are not introducing frame drops. Lastly, in Figure 19,
<code>UpdateChunksCollision()</code> is called every frame in the main game thread,
and two chunks get their collision updated, if any are waiting in the
update list populated by the separate thread.</p>
<p>Chunk collision updates are staggered instead of handling all the
waiting chunks at once, to prevent too many chunks from receiving
updates in a single frame, creating a temporary freeze. This way, the
updates are not noticeable, and a stable frame rate is kept.</p>

<p>Similar to Section 2.1.3., all the spawn and despawn positions are
handled in a separate thread for the reasons previously mentioned. In
Figure 17, besides the list updates for collision, the list updates for
spawning and despawning are also made. In Figure 20, there is a code
snippet showing how the grass and flower objects associated with the
chunks too far from the player will be removed by adding them to a list.
Their mesh pointers added to the list will be removed over multiple
frames in the game thread, and a similar process is true for spawning
the objects.</p>

<p>In the in-game screenshot of Figure 21, the implementation of
multiple draw distances through the LOD system can be seen, showing that

objects span around the player at a reduced distance than the terrain.
This implementation drastically reduces the scene memory consumption and
also reduces the number of draw calls to the GPU.</p>

<h3 id="custom-pathfinding-using-a">Custom Pathfinding using A*</h3>
<p>As mentioned in Section 1.3.5., A* is a powerful algorithm for
pathfinding, which even Unreal Engine uses behind the scenes for its
Navmesh pathfinding. The issue with Unreal’s implementation was that its
built-in Navmesh couldn’t be as detailed as needed, since the project’s
terrain is very fractal and Unreal wouldn’t compute the path from one
voxel to another.</p>
<p>For this reason, a custom implementation of A* was needed. Using the
A* library from (Hui, 2023) as a starting point, it was adapted from
Java to C++, and integrated with a Pathfinding Manager, a thread pool
that can receive pathfinding requests from the NPC class and allow each
thread to notify the NPC when a path to the goal was found (see Figure
22, 23, 24).</p>

<p>Assuming that there will be large amounts of pathfinding tasks, since
each NPC’s actions require moving to a certain location, and that there
is large number of NPCs simulated at once, moving the computations to a
separate thread was crucial to maintain a stable frame rate and not
introduce stutters. A thread pool was also needed, as it removes the
overhead of creating and destroying a thread each time a task is
completed, maintaining thus better performance by reusing threads.</p>

<p>Lastly, as seen in Figure 25, the heuristic used for the pathfinding
search is a simple Manhattan distance between the current and goal
position.</p>
<h3 id="custom-collision-checks">Custom Collision Checks</h3>
<p>As the decision for custom pathfinding implementation was taken, the
algorithm has to take into consideration obstacles, since the NPC
movement is handled completely by the project’s implementation and not
by Unreal Engine. Thus, NPCs have their collision turned off from Unreal
Engine’s perspective, and their collision is instead handled
internally.</p>
<p>The NPCs have to avoid solid objects such as trees and other NPCs.
For this, as shown in Figure 26, maps are used to store the occupied
voxels, and the voxels that should be avoided. Because of their hashing
table implementation, maps offer a great average data retrieval time
complexity of O(1), which makes them an efficient custom solution for
collision checking.</p>

<p>In Figure 27, the function <code>IsSurfacePointValid()</code> is used by a thread

<p>The vision sphere is an Unreal Engine tool that provides an

<p>Because this function is triggered extremely often by large amounts

depending on their type, this function had to be efficient. Thus, to
ensure quick checks for all the different relationship types between
NPCs, an approach inspired by the implementation of Binary Greedy
Meshing and Binary Face Culling was used, storing relationships as
positive bits in an 16-bit integer, as seen in Figure 30 and 45.</p>

Evaluation</h2>
<p>In Figure 36, a comparison between mesh generation algorithms is
made, showing an average mesh compute and render time, and memory needed
to store a single chunk’s data.</p>
<p>It is clear that not applying any technique to reduce a chunk’s
geometry is not an option, as computing and drawing so many quads
results in an unplayable simulation, with seconds long stutters. Another
issue would be running out of RAM during play time, as storing so much
data becomes not feasible.</p>
<p>Lastly, a more fair comparison is made between a traditional
implementation of face culling and greedy meshing using loops for solid
voxel checks, and the project’s more advanced implementation of these
algorithms storing solid voxels as bit flags and using bitwise
operations instead. Since both implementations should result in almost
the same geometry, the mesh render time and memory per chunk are almost
identical. The difference is in the mesh compute time, with the binary
version of these algorithms being more than 9 times faster than the
traditional implementation.</p>

the dynamic behaviours of the different types of NPCs. Particularly in
Figure 41, where multiple Tiger NPCs are attempting to attack the same
Peacock NPC prey target.</p>

<h2 id="self-reflection">Self-Reflection</h2>
<p>The project was a huge personal undertaking, because with no prior
experience in C++ and Unreal Engine and limited knowledge of the
optimisation algorithms used, learning and developing the project within
the time limit was a significant and demanding task, although a
rewarding one. Visualising the data that was created and needed for the
bitwise operations was particularly challenging and took a significant
time to get the calculations right.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-and-future-work">Conclusion and Future Work</h1>
<p>In conclusion, the project successfully achieves most of the
requirements initially set, with great optimisation results and with a
large landscape and NPC ecosystem simulation. The dynamic NPC actions
also result in interesting and almost realistic, natural
interactions.</p>
<p>As for the project’s shortcomings, because implementing a way to
fully visualise an NPC’s full list of attributes required significant
work to make it fit the current design, the NPC attributes were not
assigned based on Perlin noise, only their world position. Using noise
for manipulating attributes would’ve also increased the testing phase.
Furthermore, a more complex decision system could have been developed,
adding even more possible actions that could further increase the
interaction’s complexity. Lastly, there are a couple of pointer
mismanagement issues in the LOD system that introduce a few bugs that
can lead to a program crash. This could have been avoided through more
testing and the use of smart pointers in some cases.</p>
<p>In terms of future work, focusing on solving the current project’s
shortcomings, increasing the AI complexity while also maintaining
performance, and improving the foliage diversity and terrain biomes,
would drastically improve the simulation’s realism.</p>
